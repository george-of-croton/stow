Migrations file names should be really descriptive e.g. 'createUserTable'

Change postedId to ListingId in feedback table

Clarify variable names in API

Refactor getUserByUserName to return just one object not array with one object

use catches in promises

State should take immutable objects

Kind to import things in order you use them.
