I am proud of the code in this directory because it's simple, well organised and clear.

I like writing very modular code like this because it's easy to navigate, maintain and update. Over the course of this project
we had to review and revise our database code quite often as the scale of the project changed, or we as we added new features.
Writing the api/database functionality in this way meant we could easily add and alter the code and it was easy for my other team members to read.

This code is also super reusable, you could use similar code on a bunch of different projects, and having this experience, and the code as reference
would make setting up a database much faster in the future.
